## Token Efficiency

- Don't re-read files you just wrote/edited unless a write failed or something external changed.
- Don't re-run deterministic commands just to "double-check."
- Don't paste large code/file dumps unless asked; summarize diffs + outcomes.
- Batch related reads/commands; avoid redundant tool calls.
- Keep updates tight: what changed, why, what's left.
